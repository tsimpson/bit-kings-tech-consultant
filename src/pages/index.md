        We work with Apple Mac and Windows PC based solutions, as well as those for mobile and tablet devices including iPhone, iPad, Android and Windows Mobile. Whatever you throw at us, we’ll find a solution that lets you work on your business rather than the technology that powers it.

        An interruption in server access, a loss of important data–even a poorly managed spam filter—costs small businesses time and money. Outsourcing technology management to IT professionals like BKTC insures against this lost productivity, at a price you can afford.

    BKTC is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone. This is an edit via identity...

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
